### Things to improve/add berfore bertin@2

- Proofread and correct the documentation
- More styling option for texts (header, footer, labels, texts...): font familly, text-decoration, halo... Allow the possibility to set this in params or in each layer.
- add several epsg projections
- improve svg output file (header, layers, ...) for a better compatibility with inkscape and illustrator.
- Accept javascript functions in addition to strings in several parameters. E.g in properties.js (Cf what is done for tooltips).

### Things to think about it

- Allow customization of line marker styles (https://github.com/neocarto/bertin/issues/85)
- remove `jsts` depedency?
- refactor things?
- comment the code
- new layer types (joyplot, recmap, pie?, )
- allow png export ?
- Clip geometries for real (and not only a svg clip) with the map area.
